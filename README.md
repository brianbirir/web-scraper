# web-scraper
A web scraper Python script that runs through a web page to find content from tags.

This scraper depends on the `BeautifulSoup 4` library to scrap through a web page. Documentation for the library can be found [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#navigating-the-tree).

The script generates a CSV file from the collected links. In addition, there's a Jupyter Notebook if you want to run it directly on Jupyter.
